Analysis of Election

Overview of Election Audit

We verified the results of an election. Afterwards, we were asked to analyze the data and provide more information. The new requests were voter turnout, percentage of votes from each county compared to the total vote count and to name the county with the highest voter turnout.

 - The total number of votes were 369,711

Charles Casper Stockham with 23 percent and Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1 percent.

Election Audit Summary

This script may be used in future elections with new data. It may make sense to refactor the code, if only for readability. This isn't being used for an application where processing speed would be a consideration, though it could be made more efficient by reducing the number of IF statements. 

For readability, it may make sense to chose more intuitive variable names. For example, it's not immediately clear what "Winning county" means. 

The length of the code also seems like it could be made shorter, tidier and more efficient, as it is, it seems uneccesarily complicated.
